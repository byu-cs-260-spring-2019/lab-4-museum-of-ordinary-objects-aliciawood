## Testing

Everything should be setup. You should be able to browse to your site, e.g `lab4.mydomain.com` and have the site work.

## Debugging

If your site is not working, you should (1) look at the JavaScript console, (2) look at the Network tab in Developer Tools, (3) look at the output of the forever log (see above).
